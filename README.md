## <a name="about"></a>About
Sample NodeRed Flow to work out our loadshedding slot in City of Cape Town Area 6 and send a notification via mqtt-warn to Slack.

To work out the slots, I used the library from [Cape-Town-Loadshedding-Schedule](https://github.com/Quantiversal/Cape-Town-Loadshedding-Schedule) github repository. Many thanks to Hardmode on [zatech slack](https://zatech.slack.com/) for creating this.

* Download the json file
* Import into a new flow in [Node-Red](https://nodered.org)
